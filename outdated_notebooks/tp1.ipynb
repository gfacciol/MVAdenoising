    "# TP1: Introduction to CNN denoising\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of this lesson is to explore some basic aspects of convolutional neuronal networks (CNN) applied to denoising. We will show how to define and train a network in pytorch. As our first network, we are going to implement DCT denoising as a CNN.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will cover the following topics:\n",
    "* Define a simple CNN model inspired on DCT denoising\n",
    "* Apply a CNN to an image\n",
    "* Training a CNN\n",
    "\n",
    "There are **6 questions** in the notebook and corresponding text areas to fill-in the answers. There is also an optinal assignment for extra credit.\n",

    "#### Instructions\n",
    "To solve this TP, answer the questions below. Then export the notebook with the answers using  the menu option **File->Download as->HTML**. Send the resulting *html* file by mail to [facciolo@cmla.ens-cachan.fr](mailto:facciolo@cmla.ens-cachan.fr) with subject \"Report tp1 of SURNAME, Name\", by 26/10/2018.
